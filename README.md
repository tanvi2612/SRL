# Semantic Role Labeling

An attempt to create a Semantic Role Labeler for Hindi using Supervized Learning approach. This model is divided in to two tasks of argument identification and argument classification both created using Support Vector Machines. We use features such as chunk tags, head word of the chunk, POS-tag of the head word, dependency labels, postpositions etc. to identify the correct semantic role of each chunk.


## Dataset
The dataset used to train both the SVMs is the **Hindi PropBank** which contains approximately 1100 chunked sentences in the ssf format. We also use *FastTag* to convert the head word into vectors.

## Contriution by the team members
Each team member has contributed almost equally to the project. Initially both of us put equal efforts towards building the dataset and preprocessing. Sumanth Balaji took care of the first part of Argument Identification and Tanvi Kamble created the model for the second part i.e. Argument Classification
